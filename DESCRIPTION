Title: Build Presentation-Ready Tables Using the Grammar of Tables
Description:  Build table output from tabular data using the Grammar of Tables
    ethos. With this layering approach, we approach the building of table out
    using a separation of concerns: you don't have to decide how the data gets
    structured whilst also worrying about aesthetics.
