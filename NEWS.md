# gt (unreleased)

* There are new options for numeric formatting: (1) using significant figures (with `n_sigfig` in `fmt_number`), and (2) the ability to retain/drop trailing decimal marks (with `drop_trailing_dec_mark` in `fmt_number()`, `fmt_percent()`, and `fmt_currency()`). Thank you @drolejoel for the suggestion in #535! (#546).

* The new `scale_values` argument for `fmt_percent()` makes it easy to use values that are already scaled (and just require the percent mark). Thank you @djohn215 for the suggestion in #559. (#565)

* Restore the ability to have row striping in stub cells (with `tab_option()`'s `row.striping.include_stub = TRUE`). Thanks @gergness for creating PR #537, which prompted this final fix. (#564)

# gt 0.2.1

* `summary_rows()` and `grand_summary_rows()` no longer incorrectly calculate summary values in cases where rows aren't already sorted by group (#556).

* Ensure compatibility with **tibble** 3.0.0. (#557)

* Adapt tests to changes in dependent packages. (#575)

# gt 0.2.0.5 (2020-03-31)

* New package with 80 exported functions for building display tables

# gt 0.1.0 (unreleased)
