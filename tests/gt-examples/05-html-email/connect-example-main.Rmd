# An R Markdown Document

This is an **R Markdown** document. *Markdown* is a simple formatting syntax for writing on the web. **R Markdown** takes this a step further by combining *Markdown* prose and **R** code into reproducible documents that can be output as HTML, PDF, Word, and many more output formats. For more details on using **R Markdown**, have a look through [its documentation site](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/docs/).

Here is some **R** code, which is contained within a code chunk:

```{r diamonds_plot}

diamonds |>
  group_by(carat, cut) |>
  summarize(mean_price = mean(price)) |>
  filter(cut != "Fair", carat < 3) |>
  ggplot() +
  geom_point(aes(x = carat, y = mean_price)) +
  facet_wrap(facets = vars(cut)) +
  labs(
    title = "Diamond Prices",
    subtitle = "Faceted by Diamond Cut",
    caption = "Source: The [diamonds] dataset in {ggplot2}.",
    x = "Carats", y = "Mean Price, US Dollars"
  ) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::dollar)
```

The above created a plot. Below is code that generates a **gt** table with the diamond data. Note that we need to use the `as_raw_html()` function on the **gt** object to ensure that styles are preserved when emailing.

```{r diamonds_table}

diamonds |>
  arrange(desc(price)) |>
  filter(cut == "Ideal") |>
  head(20) |>
  gt() |>
  tab_header(title = "The finest diamonds") |>
  tab_spanner(
    label = "Dimensions",
    columns = c(depth, table, x, y, z)
  ) |>
  tab_spanner(
    label = "Attributes",
    columns = starts_with("c")
  ) |>
  cols_move_to_end(columns = price) |>
  fmt_currency(
    columns = price,
    currency = "USD",
    decimals = 0
  ) |>
  as_raw_html()
```

We can create an email using **Posit Connect**, one that aligns with the content from this report. We do this with the `render_connect_email()` and `attach_connect_email()` functions from the **blastula** package. The email subdocument (`"connect-example-email.Rmd"`) is used to craft the contents of the email, drawing upon results available in this document.

```{r connect_email, echo=FALSE}
render_connect_email(input = "connect-example-email.Rmd") |>
  attach_connect_email(
    subject = "Posit Connect HTML Email",
    attach_output = TRUE
  )
```
