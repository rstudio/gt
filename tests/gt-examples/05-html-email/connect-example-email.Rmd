# Diamonds and Real Estate in Dallas

We can include parts from the parent `"connect-example-main.Rmd"` document by adding an empty R Markdown code chunk with a matching name (in this case `diamonds_plot`). This is great because we can reuse parts from the main report document.

```{r diamonds_plot, echo=FALSE}
```

The `diamonds` table can be included in the same way:

```{r diamonds_table, echo=FALSE}
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to each of the the code chunks to prevent printing of the **R** code that generated the object.
