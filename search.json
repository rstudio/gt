Using cols_nanoplot() create new column hold nanoplots (new_col_name = \"nanoplots\"), referencing columns containing data (columns = starts_with(\"day\")). also possible define column label using new_col_label argument.    previous table showed us line-based nanoplots. can also make small bar plots cols_nanoplot(). take pizzaplace dataset make small summary table showing daily pizza sales type (four types). limited first ten days pizza sales 2015, , ten rows total. can use plot_type = \"bar\" make bar plots daily sales counts chicken, classic, supreme, veggie columns. know always four bars (one type pizza) can little creative apply colors bars use data_bar_fill_color argument nanoplot_options().    Now make another table contains two columns nanoplots. Starting towny dataset, first reduce subset columns rows. columns related either population density used input data two nanoplots. nanoplots use reference line generated median input data. naming new nanoplot-laden columns similar manner input data columns, can take advantage select helpers (e.g., using tab_spanner()). Many input data columns now redundant plots, elect hide cols_hide().    sza dataset can, just use dplyr tidyr, give us wide table full nanoplottable values. transform solar zenith angles solar altitude angles create column nanoplots using newly calculated values. NA values periods sun risen (usually 06:30 winter months) values replaced 0 using missing_vals = \"zero\". also elect create bar plots using plot_type = \"bar\" option. height plots bumped \"2.5em\" default \"2em\". Finally, use nanoplot_options() modify coloring data bars.    can use number time streams data nanoplots. demonstrate can make use creative transformation pizzaplace dataset. value stream really string delimited numeric values, like : \"7.24,84.2,14\". value stream can also contain dates /datetimes, example : \"2020-06-02 13:05:13,2020-06-02 14:24:05,2020-06-02 18:51:37\". data form can often convenient since different nanoplots might varying amounts data (holding different amounts data fixed number columns cumbersome). date time columns dataset use get x values denoting high-resolution time instants: second day pizza sold (true pizza analytics). also sell price pizza, 'll serve y values. pizzas belong four different groups (type column) group create value streams paste(..., collapse = \",\") inside  dplyr::summarize() call. two value streams row (number values) can now make gt table nanoplots.

Since lot data points connecting line valuable , also set show_data_line = FALSE nanoplot_options(). interesting see clusters differently priced pizzas entire day. Specifying currency nanoplot_options() nice touch since y values sale prices U.S. Dollars (hovering data points gives correctly formatted values). Finally, reference line based median gives pretty useful information. Seems like customers preferred getting \"chicken\"-type pizzas large size!

two calls rows_add(), two separate rows added.    possible use formula syntax rows_add() perform column resolution along attaching values new rows. wanted use equivalent value multiple cells new row, valid input form <expr> ~ <value vector>. following example, create simple table six columns (rendered gt table displays four columns stub column since group column used row group labels). add single row cell values added correspond columns resolved LHS formula expressions:    can see using starts_with(\"gr\") yields successful match group column tangible result addition row \"Group \" group (added row second one rendered gt table). use c(, b), possible add value 5 b columns. similar approach taken adding 72.63 value quantity_x quantity_y columns though used starts_with(\"quantity\") expression get gt resolve two columns. can start empty table (.e., columns rows) add one rows . completely empty table scenario, use something like dplyr::tibble() data.frame() gt(), first rows_add() rows arbitrary width. words, get generate table columns (rows) completely empty table via rows_add(). example :    , three columns three rows generated. second usage rows_add() use subset columns (three used create complete, new row). can also start virtually empty table: one columns actual rows. type multi-column, zero-row table, one needs use subset columns generating new rows rows_add().","code":"exibble |>   gt(rowname_col = \"row\") |>   rows_add(     row = \"row_9\",     num = 9.999E7,     char = \"ilama\",     fctr = \"nine\",     group = \"grp_b\"   ) exibble |>   gt(rowname_col = \"row\") |>   rows_add(     row = \"row_4.5\",     num = 9.923E3,     char = \"elderberry\",     fctr = \"eighty\",     group = \"grp_a\",     .after = \"row_4\"   ) exibble |>   gt(rowname_col = \"row\") |>   rows_add(     row = \"row_0\",     num = 0,     char = \"apple\",     fctr = \"zero\",     group = \"grp_a\",     .before = 1   ) exibble |>   gt(rowname_col = \"row\", groupname_col = \"group\") |>   rows_add(     row = c(\"row_a_end\", \"row_b_end\"),     group = c(\"grp_a\", \"grp_b\")   ) |>   tab_style(     style = cell_borders(sides = \"top\", style = \"hidden\"),     locations = list(       cells_body(rows = ends_with(\"end\")),       cells_stub(rows = ends_with(\"end\"))     )   ) |>   sub_missing(missing_text = \"\") |>   text_case_when(     grepl(\"end\", x) ~ \"\",     .locations = cells_stub()   ) |>   opt_vertical_padding(scale = 0.5) dplyr::tibble(   time = lubridate::POSIXct(),   event = character(0L) ) |>   gt() |>   rows_add(     time = lubridate::ymd_hms(\"2022-01-23 12:36:10\"),     event = \"start\"   ) |>   rows_add(     time = lubridate::ymd_hms(\"2022-01-23 13:41:26\"),     event = \"completed\"   ) dplyr::tibble(   group = c(\"Group A\", \"Group B\", \"Group B\"),   id = c(\"WG-025360\", \"WG-025361\", \"WG-025362\"),   a = c(1, 6, 2),   b = c(2, 6, 2),   quantity_x = c(83.58, 282.71, 92.20),   quantity_y = c(36.82, 282.71, 87.34) ) |>   gt(rowname_col = \"id\", groupname_col = \"group\") |>   rows_add(     starts_with(\"gr\") ~ \"Group A\",     id = \"WG-025363\",     c(a, b) ~ 5,     starts_with(\"quantity\") ~ 72.63   ) gt(dplyr::tibble()) |>   rows_add(     msrp = c(29.95, 49.95, 79.95),     item = c(\"Klax\", \"Rez\", \"Ys\"),     type = c(\"A\", \"B\", \"X\")   ) |>   rows_add(     msrp = 14.95,     item = \"D\",     type = \"Z\"   ) dplyr::tibble(   msrp = numeric(0L),   item = character(0L),   type = character(0L) ) |>   gt() |>   rows_add(     msrp = c(29.95, 49.95, 79.95, 14.95),     item = c(\"Klax\", \"Rez\", \"Ys\", \"D\"),     type = c(\"A\", \"B\", \"X\", \"Z\")   ) |>   cols_add(     genre = c(\"puzzle\", \"action\", \"RPG\", \"adventure\")   ) |>   fmt_currency() |>   cols_move_to_end(columns = msrp)"},{"path":"https://gt.rstudio.com/reference/rows_add.html","id":"function-id","dir":"Reference","previous_headings":"","what":"Function ID","title":"Add one or more rows to a gt table — rows_add","text":"6-4","code":""},{"path":"https://gt.rstudio.com/reference/rows_add.html","id":"function-introduced","dir":"Reference","previous_headings":"","what":"Function Introduced","title":"Add one or more rows to a gt table — rows_add","text":"v0.10.0 (October 7, 2023)","code":""},{"path":[]},{"path":"https://gt.rstudio.com/reference/rx_addv.html","id":null,"dir":"Reference","previous_headings":"","what":"An ADDV-flavored clinical trial toy dataset — rx_addv","title":"An ADDV-flavored clinical trial toy dataset — rx_addv","text":"tibble contains artificial protocol deviation data 180 subjects Intent--Treat (ITT) population GT01 study. dataset contains usual parameters (PARAM, PARAMCD) addv. summary parameter (PARCAT1 == \"OVERALL\") subject GT01 ITT-population, indicating whether least one major protocol deviation (PD) occurred throughout course study respective subject.
