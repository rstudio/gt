# Save a **gt** table as a file

`gtsave()` makes it easy to save a **gt** table to a file. The function
guesses the file type by the extension provided in the output filename,
producing either an HTML, PDF, PNG, LaTeX, RTF, or Word (.docx) file.

## Usage

``` r
gtsave(data, filename, path = NULL, ...)
```

## Arguments

- data:

  *The gt table data object*

  `obj:<gt_tbl>` // **required**

  This is the **gt** table object that is commonly created through use
  of the [`gt()`](https://gt.rstudio.com/reference/gt.md) function.

- filename:

  *Output filename*

  `scalar<character>` // **required**

  The file name to create on disk. Ensure that an extension compatible
  with the output types is provided (`.html`, `.tex`, `.ltx`, `.rtf`,
  `.docx`). If a custom save function is provided then the file
  extension is disregarded.

- path:

  *Output path*

  `scalar<character>` // *default:* `NULL` (`optional`)

  An optional path to which the file should be saved (combined with
  `filename`).

- ...:

  *Additional options*

  `<named arguments>`

  All other options passed to the appropriate internal saving function.

## Value

The file name (invisibly) if the export process is successful.

## Details

Output filenames with either the `.html` or `.htm` extensions will
produce an HTML document. In this case, we can pass a `TRUE` or `FALSE`
value to the `inline_css` option to obtain an HTML document with inlined
CSS styles (the default is `FALSE`). More details on CSS inlining are
available at
[`as_raw_html()`](https://gt.rstudio.com/reference/as_raw_html.md). We
can pass values to arguments in
[`htmltools::save_html()`](https://rstudio.github.io/htmltools/reference/save_html.html)
through the `...`. Those arguments are either `background` or `libdir`,
please refer to the **htmltools** documentation for more details on the
use of these arguments.

If the output filename is expressed with the `.rtf` extension then an
RTF file will be generated. In this case, there is an option that can be
passed through `...`: `page_numbering`. This controls RTF document page
numbering and, by default, page numbering is not enabled (i.e.,
`page_numbering = "none"`).

We can create an image file based on the HTML version of the `gt` table.
With the filename extension `.png`, we get a PNG image file. A PDF
document can be generated by using the `.pdf` extension. This process is
facilitated by the **webshot2** package, so, this package needs to be
installed before attempting to save any table as an image file. There is
the option of passing values to the underlying
[`webshot2::webshot()`](https://rstudio.github.io/webshot2/reference/webshot.html)
function through `...`. Some of the more useful arguments for PNG saving
are `zoom` (defaults to a scale level of `2`) and `expand` (adds
whitespace pixels around the cropped table image, and has a default
value of `5`), and `selector` (the default value is `"table"`). There
are several more options available so have a look at the **webshot2**
documentation for further details.

If the output filename extension is either of `.tex`, `.ltx`, or `.rnw`,
a LaTeX document is produced. An output filename of `.rtf` will generate
an RTF document. The LaTeX and RTF saving functions don't have any
options to pass to `...`.

If the output filename extension is `.docx`, a Word document file is
produced. This process is facilitated by the **rmarkdown** package, so
this package needs to be installed before attempting to save any table
as a `.docx` document.

## Examples

Using a small subset of the
[`gtcars`](https://gt.rstudio.com/reference/gtcars.md) dataset, we can
create a **gt** table with row labels. We'll add a stubhead label with
the [`tab_stubhead()`](https://gt.rstudio.com/reference/tab_stubhead.md)
function to describe what is in the stub.

    tab_1 <-
      gtcars |>
      dplyr::select(model, year, hp, trq) |>
      dplyr::slice(1:5) |>
      gt(rowname_col = "model") |>
      tab_stubhead(label = "car")

Export the **gt** table to an HTML file with inlined CSS (which is
necessary for including the table as part of an HTML email) using
`gtsave()` and the `inline_css = TRUE` option.

    tab_1 |> gtsave(filename = "tab_1.html", inline_css = TRUE)

By leaving out the `inline_css` option, we get a more conventional HTML
file with embedded CSS styles.

    tab_1 |> gtsave(filename = "tab_1.html")

Saving as a PNG file results in a cropped image of an HTML table. The
amount of whitespace can be set with the `expand` option.

    tab_1 |> gtsave("tab_1.png", expand = 10)

Any use of the `.tex`, `.ltx`, or `.rnw` will result in the output of a
LaTeX document.

    tab_1 |> gtsave("tab_1.tex")

With the `.rtf` extension, we'll get an RTF document.

    tab_1 |> gtsave("tab_1.rtf")

With the `.docx` extension, we'll get a word/docx document.

    tab_1 |> gtsave("tab_1.docx")
