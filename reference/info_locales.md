# View a table with info on supported locales

Many of the `fmt_*()` functions have a `locale` argument that makes
locale-based formatting easier. The table generated by the
`info_locales()` function provides a quick reference to all the
available locales. The locale identifiers are provided (base locale ID,
common display name) along with the each locale's group and decimal
separator marks. A formatted numeric example is provided (based on the
value of `11027`) to demonstrate the default formatting of each locale.

## Usage

``` r
info_locales(begins_with = NULL)
```

## Arguments

- begins_with:

  *Show locales beginning with a specific letter*

  `scalar<character>` // *default:* `NULL` (`optional`)

  Providing a single letter will filter locales to only those that begin
  with that letter in their locale ID. The default (`NULL`) will produce
  a table with all locales displayed

## Value

An object of class `gt_tbl`.

## Details

There are 574 locales, which means that a very long display table is
provided by default. To trim down the output table size, we can provide
an initial letter corresponding to the base locale ID to `begins_with`.
This will filter locales in the info table to just the set that begins
with the supplied letter.

## Examples

Get a table of info on all of the locales supported by **gt**.
