# View a table with info on supported currencies

[`fmt_currency()`](https://gt.rstudio.com/reference/fmt_currency.md)
lets us format numeric values as currencies. The table generated by
`info_currencies()` provides a quick reference to all the available
currencies. The currency identifiers are provided (name, 3-letter
currency code, and 3-digit currency code) along with the each currency's
exponent value (number of digits of the currency subunits). A formatted
example is provided (based on the value of `49.95`) to demonstrate the
default formatting of each currency.

## Usage

``` r
info_currencies(type = c("code", "symbol"), begins_with = NULL)
```

## Arguments

- type:

  *Type of currency*

  `singl-kw:[code|symbol]` // *default:* `"code"`

  The type of currency information provided. Can either be `"code"`
  where currency information corresponding to 3-letter/3-number currency
  codes is provided, or `"symbol"` where currency info for common
  currency names/symbols (e.g., dollar, pound, yen, etc.) is returned.

- begins_with:

  *Show currencies beginning with a specific letter*

  `scalar<character>` // *default:* `NULL` (`optional`)

  Providing a single letter will filter currencies to only those that
  begin with that letter in their currency code. The default (`NULL`)
  will produce a table with all currencies displayed. This option only
  constrains the information table where `type == "code"`.

## Value

An object of class `gt_tbl`.

## Details

There are 172 currencies, which can lead to a verbose display table. To
make this presentation more focused on retrieval, we can provide an
initial letter corresponding to the 3-letter currency code to
`begins_with`. This will filter currencies in the info table to just the
set beginning with the supplied letter.

## Examples

Get a table of info on all of the currencies where the three-letter code
begins with an `"h"`.

    info_currencies(begins_with = "h")
