# Get a themed font stack that works well across systems

A font stack can be obtained from `system_fonts()` using one of various
keywords such as `"system-ui"`, `"old-style"`, and `"humanist"` (there
are 15 in total) representing a themed set of fonts. These sets comprise
a font family that has been tested to work across a wide range of
computer systems. This is useful when specifying `font` values in
[`cell_text()`](https://gt.rstudio.com/reference/cell_text.md) (itself
used inside
[`tab_style()`](https://gt.rstudio.com/reference/tab_style.md)). If
using
[`opt_table_font()`](https://gt.rstudio.com/reference/opt_table_font.md),
we can invoke this function in its `stack` argument.

## Usage

``` r
system_fonts(name)
```

## Arguments

- name:

  *Name of font stack*

  `scalar<character>` // **required**

  The name of a font stack. Must be drawn from the set of `"system-ui"`,
  `"transitional"`, `"old-style"`, `"humanist"`, `"geometric-humanist"`,
  `"classical-humanist"`, `"neo-grotesque"`, `"monospace-slab-serif"`,
  `"monospace-code"`, `"industrial"`, `"rounded-sans"`, `"slab-serif"`,
  `"antique"`, `"didone"`, and `"handwritten"`.

## Value

A character vector of font names.

## The font stacks and the individual fonts used by platform

### System UI (`"system-ui"`)

    font-family: system-ui, sans-serif;

The operating system interface's default typefaces are known as system
UI fonts. They contain a variety of font weights, are quite readable at
small sizes, and are perfect for UI elements. These typefaces serve as a
great starting point for text in data tables and so this font stack is
the default for **gt**.

### Transitional (`"transitional"`)

    font-family: Charter, 'Bitstream Charter', 'Sitka Text', Cambria, serif;

The Enlightenment saw the development of transitional typefaces, which
combine Old Style and Modern typefaces. *Times New Roman*, a
transitional typeface created for the Times of London newspaper, is
among the most well-known instances of this style.

### Old Style (`"old-style"`)

    font-family: 'Iowan Old Style', 'Palatino Linotype', 'URW Palladio L', P052, serif;

Old style typefaces were created during the Renaissance and are
distinguished by diagonal stress, a lack of contrast between thick and
thin strokes, and rounded serifs. *Garamond* is among the most
well-known instances of an antique typeface.

### Humanist (`"humanist"`)

    font-family: Seravek, 'Gill Sans Nova', Ubuntu, Calibri, 'DejaVu Sans', source-sans-pro, sans-serif;

Low contrast between thick and thin strokes and organic, calligraphic
forms are traits of humanist typefaces. These typefaces, which draw
their inspiration from Renaissance calligraphy, are frequently regarded
as being more readable and easier to read than other sans serif
typefaces.

### Geometric Humanist (`"geometric-humanist"`)

    font-family: Avenir, Montserrat, Corbel, 'URW Gothic', source-sans-pro, sans-serif;

Clean, geometric forms and consistent stroke widths are characteristics
of geometric humanist typefaces. These typefaces, which are frequently
used for headlines and other display purposes, are frequently thought to
be contemporary and slick in appearance. A well-known example of this
classification is *Futura*.

### Classical Humanist (`"classical-humanist"`)

    font-family: Optima, Candara, 'Noto Sans', source-sans-pro, sans-serif;

The way the strokes gradually widen as they approach the stroke
terminals without ending in a serif is what distinguishes classical
humanist typefaces. The stone carving on Renaissance-era tombstones and
classical Roman capitals served as inspiration for these typefaces.

### Neo-Grotesque (`"neo-grotesque"`)

    font-family: Inter, Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', 'Arial Nova', 'Nimbus Sans', Arial, sans-serif;

Neo-grotesque typefaces are a form of sans serif that originated in the
late 19th and early 20th centuries. They are distinguished by their
crisp, geometric shapes and regular stroke widths. *Helvetica* is among
the most well-known examples of a Neo-grotesque typeface.

### Monospace Slab Serif (`"monospace-slab-serif"`)

    font-family: 'Nimbus Mono PS', 'Courier New', monospace;

Monospace slab serif typefaces are distinguished by their fixed-width
letters, which are the same width irrespective of their shape, and their
straightforward, geometric forms. For reports, tabular work, and
technical documentation, this technique is used to simulate typewriter
output.

### Monospace Code (`"monospace-code"`)

    font-family: ui-monospace, 'Cascadia Code', 'Source Code Pro', Menlo, Consolas, 'DejaVu Sans Mono', monospace;

Specifically created for use in programming and other technical
applications, monospace code typefaces are used in these fields. These
typefaces are distinguished by their clear, readable forms and
monospaced design, which ensures that all letters and characters are the
same width.

### Industrial (`"industrial"`)

    font-family: Bahnschrift, 'DIN Alternate', 'Franklin Gothic Medium', 'Nimbus Sans Narrow', sans-serif-condensed, sans-serif;

The development of industrial typefaces began in the late 19th century
and was greatly influenced by the industrial and technological
advancements of the time. Industrial typefaces are distinguished by
their strong sans serif letterforms, straightforward appearance, and use
of geometric shapes and straight lines.

### Rounded Sans (`"rounded-sans"`)

    font-family: ui-rounded, 'Hiragino Maru Gothic ProN', Quicksand, Comfortaa, Manjari, 'Arial Rounded MT', 'Arial Rounded MT Bold', Calibri, source-sans-pro, sans-serif;

The rounded, curved letterforms that define rounded typefaces give them
a softer, friendlier appearance. The typeface's rounded edges give it a
more natural and playful feel, making it appropriate for use in casual
or kid-friendly designs. Since the 1950s, the rounded sans-serif design
has gained popularity and is still frequently used in branding, graphic
design, and other fields.

### Slab Serif (`"slab-serif"`)

    font-family: Rockwell, 'Rockwell Nova', 'Roboto Slab', 'DejaVu Serif', 'Sitka Small', serif;

Slab Serif typefaces are distinguished by the thick, block-like serifs
that appear at the ends of each letterform. Typically, these serifs are
unbracketed, which means that they do not have any curved or tapered
transitions to the letter's main stroke.

### Antique (`"antique"`)

    font-family: Superclarendon, 'Bookman Old Style', 'URW Bookman', 'URW Bookman L', 'Georgia Pro', Georgia, serif;

Serif typefaces that were popular in the 19th century include antique
typefaces, also referred to as Egyptians. They are distinguished by
their thick, uniform stroke weight and block-like serifs.

### Didone (`"didone"`)

    font-family: Didot, 'Bodoni MT', 'Noto Serif Display', 'URW Palladio L', P052, Sylfaen, serif;

Didone typefaces, also referred to as Modern typefaces, are
distinguished by their vertical stress, sharp contrast between thick and
thin strokes, and hairline serifs without bracketing. The Didone style
first appeared in the late 18th century and became well-known in the
early 19th century.

### Handwritten (`"handwritten"`)

    font-family: 'Segoe Print', 'Bradley Hand', Chilanka, TSCu_Comic, casual, cursive;

The appearance and feel of handwriting are replicated by handwritten
typefaces. Although there are a wide variety of handwriting styles, this
font stack tends to use a more casual and commonplace style.

## Examples

Use a subset of the [`sp500`](https://gt.rstudio.com/reference/sp500.md)
dataset to create a **gt** table with 10 rows. For the `date` column and
the column labels, let's use a different font stack (the `"industrial"`
one). The system fonts used in this particular stack are
`"Bahnschrift"`, `"DIN Alternate"`, `"Franklin Gothic Medium"`, and
`"Nimbus Sans Narrow"` (the generic `"sans-serif-condensed"` and
`"sans-serif"` are used if the aforementioned fonts aren't available).

    sp500 |>
      dplyr::slice(1:10) |>
      dplyr::select(-volume, -adj_close) |>
      gt() |>
      fmt_currency() |>
      tab_style(
        style = cell_text(
          font = system_fonts(name = "industrial"),
          size = px(18)
        ),
        locations = list(
          cells_body(columns = date),
          cells_column_labels()
        )
      )
