#' Yearly populations of countries from 1960 to 2022
#'
#' @description
#'
#' A dataset that presents yearly, total populations of countries. Total
#' population is based on counts of all residents regardless of legal status or
#' citizenship. Country identifiers include the English-language country names,
#' and the 2- and 3-letter ISO 3166-1 country codes. Each row contains a
#' `population` value for a given `year` (from 1960 to 2022). Any `NA` values
#' for `populations` indicate the non-existence of the entity during that year.
#'
#' @format A tibble with 13,545 rows and 5 variables:

#' \item{country_name}{The name of the country.}
#' \item{country_code_2, country_code_3}{The 2- and 3-letter ISO 3166-1 country

#' Twice hourly solar zenith angles by month & latitude
#'
#' @description
#'
#' This dataset contains solar zenith angles (in degrees, with the range of
#' 0-90) every half hour from 04:00 to 12:00, true solar time. This set of
#' values is calculated on the first of every month for 4 different northern
#' hemisphere latitudes. For determination of afternoon values, the presented
#' tabulated values are symmetric about noon.
#'
#' @details
#'
#' The solar zenith angle (SZA) is one measure that helps to describe the sun's
#' path across the sky. It's defined as the angle of the sun relative to a line
#' perpendicular to the earth's surface. It is useful to calculate the SZA in
#' relation to the true solar time. True solar time relates to the position of
#' the sun with respect to the observer, which is different depending on the
#' exact longitude. For example, two hours before the sun crosses the meridian
#' (the highest point it would reach that day) corresponds to a true solar time
#' of 10 a.m. The SZA has a strong dependence on the observer's latitude. For
#' example, at a latitude of 50 degrees N at the start of January, the noontime
#' SZA is 73.0 but a different observer at 20 degrees N would measure the
#' noontime SZA to be 43.0 degrees.
#'
#' @format A tibble with 816 rows and 4 variables:

#' \item{latitude}{The latitude in decimal degrees for the observations.}

#' is also given.
#'
#' @details

#' a fine limousine (e.g., a Rolls-Royce Phantom EWB). You'll find that, with

#' A dataset containing census population data from six census years (1996 to

#' The stations of the Paris Metro
#'
#' @description
#'
#' A dataset with information on all 314 Paris Metro stations as of June 2024.
#' Each record represents a station, describing which Metro lines are serviced
#' by the station, which other connections are available, and annual passenger
#' volumes. Basic location information is provided for each station in terms
#' of where they reside on a municipal level, and, through latitude/longitude
#' coordinate values.
#'
#' The system has 16 lines (numbered from 1 to 14, with two additional lines:
#' 3bis and 7bis) and covers over 200 kilometers of track. The Metro runs on
#' standard gauge tracks (1,435 mm) and operates using a variety of rolling
#' stock, including rubber-tired trains and steel-wheeled trains (which are far
#' more common).
#'
#' The Metro is operated by the RATP, which also operates other transit systems
#' in the region, including buses, trams, and the RER. The RER is an important
#' component of the region's transit infrastructure, and several RER stations
#' have connectivity with the Metro. This integration allows passengers to
#' transfer between those two systems seamlessly. The Metro also has connections
#' to the Transilien rail network, tramway stations, several major train
#' stations (e.g., Gare du Nord, Gare de l'Est, etc.), and many bus lines.

#' @description
#'
#' A dataset with artificial daily lab data for a patient with Yellow Fever
#' (YF). The table comprises laboratory findings for the patient from day 3 of
#' illness onset until day 9 (after which the patient died). YF viral DNA was

#' per mL. Several medical interventions were taken to help the patient,
#' including the administration of fresh frozen plasma, platelets, red cells,
#' and coagulation factor VIII. The patient also received advanced support
#' treatment in the form of mechanical ventilation and plasmapheresis. Though
#' the patient's temperature remained stable during their illness,

#' Data on photolysis rates for gas-phase organic compounds

#' @description
#'
#' The `photolysis` dataset contains numerical values for describing the
#' photolytic degradation pathways of 25 compounds of relevance in atmospheric
#' chemistry. Many volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are emitted in substantial

#' can be transformed into other VOCs via the energy provided from light.
#'
#' In order to realistically predict the composition of the atmosphere and how
#' it evolves over time, we need accurate estimates of photolysis rates. The
#' data provided here in `photolysis` allows for computations of photolysis
