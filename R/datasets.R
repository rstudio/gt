#' Yearly populations of countries from 1960 to 2017
#'
#' @description
#'
#' A dataset that presents yearly, total populations of countries. Total
#' population is based on counts of all residents regardless of legal status or
#' citizenship. Country identifiers include the English-language country names,
#' and the 2- and 3-letter ISO 3166-1 country codes. Each row contains a
#' `population` value for a given `year` (from 1960 to 2017). Any `NA` values
#' for `populations` indicate the non-existence of the country during that year.

#' Twice hourly solar zenith angles by month & latitude
#'
#' @description
#'
#' This dataset contains solar zenith angles (in degrees, with the range of
#' 0-90) every half hour from 04:00 to 12:00, true solar time. This set of
#' values is calculated on the first of every month for 4 different northern
#' hemisphere latitudes. For determination of afternoon values, the presented
#' tabulated values are symmetric about noon.
#'
#' @details
#'
#' The solar zenith angle (SZA) is one measure that helps to describe the sun's
#' path across the sky. It's defined as the angle of the sun relative to a line
#' perpendicular to the earth's surface. It is useful to calculate the SZA in
#' relation to the true solar time. True solar time relates to the position of
#' the sun with respect to the observer, which is different depending on the
#' exact longitude. For example, two hours before the sun crosses the meridian
#' (the highest point it would reach that day) corresponds to a true solar time
#' of 10 a.m. The SZA has a strong dependence on the observer's latitude. For
#' example, at a latitude of 50 degrees N at the start of January, the noontime
#' SZA is 73.0 but a different observer at 20 degrees N would measure the
#' noontime SZA to be 43.0 degrees.
#'
#' @format A tibble with 816 rows and 4 variables:
#' \describe{
#'   \item{latitude}{The latitude in decimal degrees for the observations.}
#'   \item{month}{The measurement month. All calculations where conducted

#' @description
#'
#' Expensive and fast cars. Not your father's `mtcars`. Each row describes a car
#' of a certain make, model, year, and trim. Basic specifications such as

#' is also given.
#'

#' prices): they are all grand tourer vehicles. These are proper GT cars that
#' blend pure driving thrills with a level of comfort that is more expected from
#' a fine limousine (e.g., a Rolls-Royce Phantom EWB). You'll find that, with
#' these cars, comfort is emphasized over all-out performance. Nevertheless, the

#' @description
#'
#' This tibble contains artificial data for 182 subjects of the `GT01` study.
#' Each row corresponds to demographic characteristics of a single trial

#' ethnicity and body mass index (BMI) at baseline, as well as an event
#' flag, indicating whether the subject experienced a specific event
#' throughout the course of the study or not.
#'
#' Although the data was intentionally created to mimic a typical clinical
#' trial dataset following the CDISC format, it might not strictly comply
#' with CDISC ADaM rules. The intent is to showcase the workflow for clinical
#' table creation rather than creating a fully CDISC-compliant ADaM dataset.
