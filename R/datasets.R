#' Yearly populations of countries from 1960 to 2022
#'
#' @description
#'
#' A dataset that presents yearly, total populations of countries. Total
#' population is based on counts of all residents regardless of legal status or
#' citizenship. Country identifiers include the English-language country names,
#' and the 2- and 3-letter ISO 3166-1 country codes. Each row contains a
#' `population` value for a given `year` (from 1960 to 2022). Any `NA` values
#' for `populations` indicate the non-existence of the entity during that year.
#'
#' @format A tibble with 13,545 rows and 5 variables:

#' \item{country_name}{The name of the country.}
#' \item{country_code_2, country_code_3}{The 2- and 3-letter ISO 3166-1 country

#' Twice hourly solar zenith angles by month & latitude
#'
#' @description
#'
#' This dataset contains solar zenith angles (in degrees, with the range of
#' 0-90) every half hour from 04:00 to 12:00, true solar time. This set of
#' values is calculated on the first of every month for 4 different northern
#' hemisphere latitudes. For determination of afternoon values, the presented
#' tabulated values are symmetric about noon.
#'
#' @details
#'
#' The solar zenith angle (SZA) is one measure that helps to describe the sun's
#' path across the sky. It's defined as the angle of the sun relative to a line
#' perpendicular to the earth's surface. It is useful to calculate the SZA in
#' relation to the true solar time. True solar time relates to the position of
#' the sun with respect to the observer, which is different depending on the
#' exact longitude. For example, two hours before the sun crosses the meridian
#' (the highest point it would reach that day) corresponds to a true solar time
#' of 10 a.m. The SZA has a strong dependence on the observer's latitude. For
#' example, at a latitude of 50 degrees N at the start of January, the noontime
#' SZA is 73.0 but a different observer at 20 degrees N would measure the
#' noontime SZA to be 43.0 degrees.
#'

#' \item{latitude}{The latitude in decimal degrees for the observations.}

#' a fine limousine (e.g., a Rolls-Royce Phantom EWB). You'll find that, with

#'
#' A dataset containing census population data from six census years (1996 to

#' such as location (in the `latitude` and `longitude` columns), their website

#' The stations of the Paris Metro

#' terms where they reside on a municipal level, and, through latitude/longitude
#' coordinates.

#' 3bis and 7bis) and covers over 200 kilometers of track. The Metro runs on

#' stock, including rubber-tired trains and steel-wheeled trains (which are far
#' more common).
#'
#' The Metro is operated by the RATP, which also operates other transit systems
#' in the region, including buses, trams, and the RER. The RER is an important
#' component of the region's transit infrastructure, and several RER stations
#' have connectivity with the Metro. This integration allows passengers to

#' Lab tests for one suffering from an illness
#'
#' @description
#'
#' A dataset with artificial daily lab data for a patient with Yellow Fever
#' (YF). The table comprises laboratory findings for the patient from day 3 of
#' illness onset until day 9 (after which the patient died). YF viral DNA was
#' found in serum samples from day 3, where the viral load reached 14,000 copies
#' per mL. Several medical interventions were taken to help the patient,
#' including the administration of fresh frozen plasma, platelets, red cells,
#' and coagulation factor VIII. The patient also received advanced support
#' treatment in the form of mechanical ventilation and plasmapheresis. Though
#' the patient's temperature remained stable during their illness,
#' unfortunately, the patient's condition did not improve. On days 7 and 8, the
#' patient's health declined further, with symptoms such as nosebleeds,
#' gastrointestinal bleeding, and hematoma.

#' @description
#'
#' This tibble contains artificial data for 182 subjects of the `GT01` study.
#' Each row corresponds to demographic characteristics of a single trial
#' participant. Two out of 182 study participants were screen failures and
#' thus not treated, the rest of the study population was randomized with a
#' 1:1 ratio to receive either `"Placebo"` (as comparator) or `"Drug 1"`. The
#' dataset entails subject level demographics such as age, age group, sex,
#' ethnicity, and body mass index (BMI) at baseline, as well as an event
#' flag, indicating whether the subject experienced a specific event
#' throughout the course of the study or not.
#'
#' Although the data was intentionally created to mimic a typical clinical
#' trial dataset following the CDISC format, it might not strictly comply
