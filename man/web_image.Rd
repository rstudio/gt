\title{Helper function for adding an image from the web}
\usage{
web_image(url, height = 30)
}
\arguments{
\item{url}{A url that resolves to an image file.}

\item{height}{The absolute height (px) of the image in the table cell.}
}
\value{
A character object with an HTML fragment that can be placed inside of
a cell.
}
\description{
We can flexibly add a web image inside of a table with \code{web_image()}
function. The function provides a convenient way to generate an HTML fragment
with an image URL. Because this function is currently HTML-based, it is only
useful for HTML table output. To use this function inside of data cells, it
is recommended that the \code{\link[=text_transform]{text_transform()}} function is used. With that
function, we can specify which data cells to target and then include a
\code{web_image()} call within the required user-defined function (for the \code{fn}
argument). If we want to include an image in other places (e.g., in the
header, within footnote text, etc.) we need to use \code{web_image()} within the
\code{\link[=html]{html()}} helper function.
}
\details{
By itself, the function creates an HTML image tag, so, the call
\code{web_image("http://some.web.site/image.png")} evaluates to:

\verb{<img src=\\"http://some.web.site/image.png\\" style=\\"height:30px;\\">}

where a height of \verb{30px} is a default height chosen to work well within the
heights of most table rows.
