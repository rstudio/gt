\description{
A synthetic dataset that describes pizza sales for a pizza place somewhere in
the US. While the contents are artificial, the ingredients used to make the
pizzas are far from it. There are 32 different pizzas that fall into 4
different categories: \code{classic} (classic pizzas: 'You probably had one like
it before, but never like this!'), \code{chicken} (pizzas with chicken as a major
ingredient: 'Try the Southwest Chicken Pizza! You'll love it!'), \code{supreme}
(pizzas that try a little harder: 'My Soppressata pizza uses only the finest
salami from my personal salumist!'), and, \code{veggie} (pizzas without any meats
whatsoever: 'My Five Cheese pizza has so many cheeses, I can only offer it in
Large Size!').
