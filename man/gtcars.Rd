\format{A tibble with 47 rows and 15 variables:
\describe{
  \item{mfr}{The name of the car manufacturer}
  \item{model}{The car's model name}
  \item{year}{The car's model year}
  \item{trim}{A short description of the car model's trim}
  \item{bdy_style}{An identifier of the car's body style, which is either
  \code{coupe}, \code{convertible}, \code{sedan}, or \code{hatchback}}
  \item{hp, hp_rpm}{The car's horsepower and the associated RPM level}

  \code{rwd} (Rear Wheel Drive) or \code{awd} (All Wheel Drive)}
  \item{trsmn}{The codified transmission type, where the number part is

\description{
Expensive and fast cars. Not your father's \code{mtcars}. Each row describes
a car of a certain make, model, year, and trim. Basic specifications such as
horsepower, torque, EPA MPG ratings, type of drivetrain, and transmission
characteristics are provided. The country of origin for the car manufacturer
is also given.
}
\details{
All of the \code{gtcars} have something else in common (aside from the high
asking prices): they are all grand tourer vehicles. These are proper GT cars
that blend pure driving thrills with a level of comfort that is more expected
from a fine limousine (e.g., a Rolls-Royce Phantom EWB). You'll find that,
with these cars, comfort is emphasized over all-out performance.
Nevertheless, the driving experience should also mean motoring at speed,
doing so in style and safety.
