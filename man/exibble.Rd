\title{A toy example tibble for testing with gt: exibble}
\format{A tibble with 8 rows and 9 variables:
\describe{
  \item{num}{a numeric column ordered with increasingly larger values}
  \item{char}{a character column composed of names of fruits from \code{a} to
  \code{h}}
  \item{fctr}{a factor column with numbers from 1 to 8, written out}
  \item{date, time, datetime}{character columns with dates, times, and
  datetimes}
  \item{currency}{a numeric column that is useful for testing currency-based
  formatting}
  \item{row}{a character column in the format \code{row_X} which can be
  useful for testing with row captions in a table stub}
  \item{group}{a character column with four \code{grp_a} values and four
  \code{grp_b} values which can be useful for testing tables that contain
  row groups}

\description{
This tibble contains data of a few different classes, which makes it
well-suited for quick experimentation with the functions in this package. It
contains only eight rows with numeric, character, and factor columns. The
last 4 rows contain \code{NA} values in the majority of this tibble's columns
(1 missing value per column). The \code{date}, \code{time}, and
\code{datetime} columns are character-based dates/times in the familiar ISO
8601 format. The \code{row} and \code{group} columns provide for unique
rownames and two groups (\code{grp_a} and \code{grp_b}) for experimenting
with the \code{\link{gt}()} function's \code{rowname_col} and
\code{groupname_col} arguments.
