The column names are formally called **column labels**. This distinguishes these entities from their former role as columns names in a data table. The default behavior in the transition from data table to display table is to inherit the **column labels** from the column names. However, we can explicitly set the label text for any of the **column labels** with the `col_labels()` function.
