gt provides an option to make interactive html tables via the [reactable](https://glin.github.io/reactable/index.html) package.

It also provides an interactive to creating gt tables as plots.

Let's use the following base for our gt table.

```{r}
library(gt)
gt_tbl <- exibble |>
  gt()
```

To create an interactive table, you have simply have to pipe `opt_interactive()` to your existing gt pipeline.

```{r}
gt_tbl
```

```{r}
gt_tbl |>
  opt_interactive()
```

# Current limitations

* Some features like `tab_style()` may not be fully supported. 

* `summary_rows()` and `grand_summary_rows()` have yet to be implemented.

* Your interactive table may be visually different from your non-interactive table.
